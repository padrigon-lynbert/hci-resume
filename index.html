                <p>
                    A while back, when I was just a 10th grader, I began programming in backend languages and started playing around Unity and Unreal. However, a few months later, I lost interest in gaming. Since then, learning various dsa, languages, and other topics had been a hobby of mine for quite a while. Driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and personal growth I maintained a vigilant watch over my own progress, striving for continuous improvement. Currently, I'm immersed in AI, complementing my college education with online courses, trying to master something while sadly pursuing my college education.

                            Inspired by my early passion in game development, I started off learning programming in languages like C family, mainly to use game engines properly. But as my interest in gaming faded,  I shifted my focus to honing my skills in Python, JS, and Java, particularly in backend algorithms. Unfortunately, I eventually lost interest in programming altogether,which resulted in a months-long period of inactivity.

                        <p>
                            I often missed classes so that I could spend more time learning to code. I chose to pick up programming again after a protracted absence, and this time it went more quickly. My love for coding was rekindled during my teenage experiments in senior high school. I spent weeks experimenting with different things without a clear plan before deciding to become a software programmer. I thoroughly studied studying Java and Android Studio during this era. I also went back over C++ again, understanding its structure and usefulness as a worthwhile exercise. During this time, I also started learning about Linux. I occupied my time with cybersecurity and hacking, inspired by watching Mr. Robot. Early on, there was nothing but sheer excitement as building and experimentation took place.

                            Finally ditched the idea of becomming a software engineer it's soft and gay, I want a more hot blazing gangsta one for alpha boys sheeesh. 
                            In the end, I made the decision to specialize in AI, primarily in Python, though I still intend to learn more about other languages. It wasn't a fun voyage, even if it required rapidly picking up the requisite numbers and ideas.
                            My motivation for learning AI extends beyond personal interestâ€”it aligns with my long-term goals.
                            As I understand AI's limitless potential and how important it will be to my future aspirations, I'm currently working hard to improve my abilities and dependability in the sector.
